# data viz with ggplot


### load packages 

We can use the `library()` function to load the packages we need. The `tidyverse` package contains tons of useful functions for data wrangling and visualisation (including ggplot). The `ozbabynames` package contains data from birth records in Australia. 


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ozbabynames)

```

### read the babynames data

```{r}
ozbabynames <- ozbabynames

glimpse(ozbabynames)

```


### define the names you want to compare

btw Lady Gaga's real name is Stefani

```{r}
artist_names <- c("Billie", "Taylor", "Stefani")

```

### whose name is most popular?? 

```{r}

ozbabynames %>%
  filter(name %in% artist_names) %>%
  group_by(name, year) %>% 
  summarise(count = sum(count)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, 
             y = count,
             colour = name)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_bw() +
 facet_wrap(~name,
             scales = "free_y") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```



What does the `scales = "free y"` do? What happens if you delete it? Is the plot more meaningful with "free y" or without it?


### Recreate the plot above with your names 

```{r}
your_names <- c("name1", "name2", "name3")
```

What do you need to change about the code below to make it plot your names?

```{r}
ozbabynames %>%
  filter(name %in% artist_names) %>%
  group_by(name, year) %>% 
  summarise(count = sum(count)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, 
             y = count,
             colour = name)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_bw() +
 facet_wrap(~name,
             scales = "free_y") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

Do you need `scales = "free_y"`?
