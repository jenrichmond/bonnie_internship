As it so happens, there are at least 6 "Table 1" packages available. Each offers similar functions, with a few variations. I've provided a summary of each below, in an attempt to find a package that will provide me with the values (and hopefully also the layout) closest to the descriptives table I am trying to replicate for Paper 1.

### 1. tableone
This is the package I used last week. 

Pros:
- Summarise continuous & categorical variables.
- Categorical variables can be summarised as counts and/or percentages.
- Continuous variables can be summarised "normally" (mean & SD) or "non-normally" (median & IQR).
- Allows for layout where descriptive statistics are displayed as individual columns & all experimental variables are displayed as individual rows.

Cons: 
- No function for range.
- Cannot customise the design of the table (e.g., in a style resembling APA format).

Here is how descriptives are shown in tableone using the data from Paper 1:

```{r out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img","tableone_1.png"))
```

See - https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tableone/vignettes/introduction.html

### 2. table1
Presents descriptive statistics of the study population stratified by treatment condition.

Pros:
- HTML output that can be used with knitr and Rmd without being affected.
- Flexibility to customise (to some extent) table contents & layout.
- Can request different statistics for specific variables (e.g., median & range for age; mean & SD for weight).

Cons:
- Cannot change the layout of the table so each column represents a descriptive statistic.

```{r out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img","table1.png"))
```

Note: the above table is taken from the CRAN vignette, as the Paper 1 data is messy when displayed in this kind of table.

See - https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/table1/vignettes/table1-examples.html

### 3. TableOne
Not much information is available on this package; all Git data was last updated 2 years ago. 

Pros:
- Specific functions for summarising and presenting dichotomous, ordinal and continuous data.

Cons:
- The package appears to be quite limited in functionality.
- Only accepts data directly from an Excel document.

See - https://github.com/agapiospanos/TableOne

### 4. Table1
< Brief summary >

Pros:
- (make.table) can be outputted as PDF, HTML or printed to R console.
- Optional inputs for headers, row names, summary statistics, etc. to customise the output.
- Table can be stratified by one or more variables.
- Quicker alternative (quick.table) classifies variables as categorical/continuous and generates a set of summary statistics for all available variables.

Cons:
- Cannot change the layout of the table so each column represents a descriptive statistic.

```{r out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img","Table1_1.png"))
```

### 5. Furniture (table1)
Provides a simple summary table with means/counts and SDs/percentages.

Pros:
- Uses a similar API to tidyverse groups and can be used in a pipe.
- Provides bivariate test results for variable with grouping variable.
- Flexible output: printed in console output, in latex (e.g., through kable), markdown and pandoc.
- Can be exported to CSV.

Cons:
- A little too simplistic; no clear row or column labels, no option for HTML format, limited ability to customise layout.

```{r out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img","furniture.png"))
```

See - https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/furniture/vignettes/Table1.html

### 6. apaTables
Produces tables that conform to APA style for several different types of analyses, e.g., correlation, ANOVA.

Pros:
- Automates the process by which tables are created from analyses using R.
- Ensures the tables are reproducible.

Cons:
- Functions are restricted to specific analyses; limited ability to custome layout. 
- Package is for tables generated from analyses only; no specific table for descriptives, although correlation or one-way ANOVA table functions will produce a descriptives table (showing mean and SD only).

```{r out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img","apatables.png"))
```
Note: the above table is taken from the CRAN vignette.

See - https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/apaTables/index.html

### 7. arsenal
Comprises 6 functions designed to make statistical reporting easy. The relevant function for Table 1 is tableby(), which summarises a set of independent variables by one or more categorical variables. 

Pros:
- Lots of functionality: can customise most any aspect of the table.
- Requires very little code, e.g., can create a table using only two lines of code.
- Can stratify table by more than one grouping variable.
- Can create a very simple table without any groupings.

Cons:
- None that I am aware of at this stage!

```{r out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img","arsenal.png"))
```

### 8. qwraps2
Comprises numerous functions to summarise data and format results. These functions, or similar, can be found in other R packages.

Pros:
- Extremely flexible; can customise every single line of a summary table.
- Formatting tools, e.g., summary_table() for data summary tables in markdown; mean_sd, mean_ci for reporting formatted summary statistics.
- Plotting tools, e.g., ggplot2_extract_legend() to extract the legend from a ggplot.

Cons:
- Long lines of code.

```{r out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img","qwraps.png"))
```
