    "contents": "\na recap on the second week\nPlaying catch-up on my other courses had me neglecting this project for most of the week, so I’m glad I was able to spend Sunday reacquainting myself with R and running basic demographics for Paper 1 (2016).\nI started by converting the open data from each study into a .csv file, since some were .sav and others in various other formats. I then familiarised myself with each paper to ascertain which files were required for data replication. Some papers had multiple datasets with vague names, so this was a little tricky!\nJenny then put together a template for me to follow to perform the functions:\nread_csv(here) to read in data from Excel\nclean_names() to clean up the variable names and make them more decipherable\nglimpse() to obtain a summary of the dataset\ncount() to determine the number of participants\nsummarise() to obtain demographics, e.g., mean, SD\ntabyl() to count how many participants were assigned to each condition\nI had a basic understanding of R from the RYouWithMe online learning resources, but had not looked at these since mid-2020. So it was exciting to be presented with a new challenge and to encounter some unfamiliar functions (e.g., tabyl), and use various R blogs and databases to understand what each function performs and how to execute the command. It took some time trying to understand the aspects of the code (e.g., the piping function %>%), but I feel like I’ve learnt a lot today and already feel vastly more comfortable using R!\n\n\n\n",

What happens if you delete it? Is the plot more meaningful with “free y” or without it?\nChanges the scale on the Y axis so that it varies for each plot depending on the frequency for each, e.g., for Stefani, the plot appears as almost a straight line when ‘free y’ is removed, but more clearly shows a peak around 1998 when ‘free y’ is added.\nRecreate the plot above with your names\n\n\nyour_names <- c(\"Bonnie\", \"Siobhan\")\n\n\n\nWhat do you need to change about the code below to make it plot your names?\n\n\nozbabynames %>%\n  filter(name %in% your_names) %>%\n  group_by(name, year) %>% \n  summarise(count = sum(count)) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = year, \n             y = count,\n             colour = name)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  theme_bw() +\n facet_wrap(~name,\n            scales = \"free_y\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\nDo you need scales = \"free_y\"?\nMaybe. Without it, the data for the name “Siobhan” appears as a somewhat flat, squiggly line, but it is easy to compare it to the name Bonnie when they are placed side by side.\n\n\n\n",

I can pull up the page by searching for it in the search bar on my blog, but there is no direct link from my site at the moment.\nI did not put together a plan for each week, so that will be a task for this week! As well as starting to look at the 2016 paper and determining the steps required to replicate the data on R.\n\n\n\n",
