    "contents": "\nI was initially made aware of another four packages designed to produce Table 1, all variations on the spelling of the package I used (tableone). The rndr function that I learned about is actually part of a separate package, and so I decided tableone was not going to be adequate for the data I needed to replicate in Table 1 for Paper 1.\nIn trying to determine which of the other four packages would be best suited for Table 1, I happened upon a total of 12 “Table 1” packages. I realised that each of the papers is likely going to require slightly different data in the tables, and as such, decided it would be worth doing a review of all 12. I tried producing a table from each of the packages using the Paper 1 data, but there were a few packages that were too complex (for me) or that didn’t work for the data I had, in which case, I inserted a screenshot of the example tables given on the respective package vignette.\nAfter reviewing each of the packages, I have decided arsenal is the best choice. It provides the descriptives I need for Table 1 (mean, sd, range) and has a lot of functionality so I can customise it to replicate Paper 1 as closely as possible.\nI had hoped to reproduce all tables and graphs from Paper 1 this week, but I’m glad that I’m now aware of the different table packages and feel more comfortable finding one to best replicate each of the papers I have chosen. For the week ahead, I hope to achieve what I couldn’t last week - reproducing all tables and graphs from Paper 1!\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nAs it so happens, there are at least 6 “Table 1” packages available. Each offers similar functions, with a few variations. I’ve provided a summary of each below, in an attempt to find a package that will provide me with the values (and hopefully also the layout) closest to the descriptives table I am trying to replicate for Paper 1.\n1. tableone\nThis is the package I used last week.\nPros: - Summarise continuous & categorical variables. - Categorical variables can be summarised as counts and/or percentages. - Continuous variables can be summarised “normally” (mean & SD) or “non-normally” (median & IQR). - Allows for layout where descriptive statistics are displayed as individual columns & all experimental variables are displayed as individual rows.\nCons: - No function for range. - Cannot customise the design of the table (e.g., in a style resembling APA format).\nHere is how descriptives are shown in tableone using the data from Paper 1:\n\n\nknitr::include_graphics(here::here(\"img\",\"tableone_1.png\"))\n\n\n\n\nSee - https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tableone/vignettes/introduction.html\n2. table1\nPresents descriptive statistics of the study population stratified by treatment condition.\nPros: - HTML output that can be used with knitr and Rmd without being affected. - Flexibility to customise (to some extent) table contents & layout. - Can request different statistics for specific variables (e.g., median & range for age; mean & SD for weight).\nCons: - Cannot change the layout of the table so each column represents a descriptive statistic.\n\n\nknitr::include_graphics(here::here(\"img\",\"table1.png\"))\n\n\n\n\nNote: the above table is taken from the CRAN vignette, as the Paper 1 data is messy when displayed in this kind of table.\nSee - https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/table1/vignettes/table1-examples.html\n3. TableOne\nNot much information is available on this package; all Git data was last updated 2 years ago.\nPros: - Specific functions for summarising and presenting dichotomous, ordinal and continuous data.\nCons: - The package appears to be quite limited in functionality. - Only accepts data directly from an Excel document.\nSee - https://github.com/agapiospanos/TableOne\n4. Table1\n< Brief summary >\nPros: - (make.table) can be outputted as PDF, HTML or printed to R console. - Optional inputs for headers, row names, summary statistics, etc. to customise the output. - Table can be stratified by one or more variables. - Quicker alternative (quick.table) classifies variables as categorical/continuous and generates a set of summary statistics for all available variables.\nCons: - Cannot change the layout of the table so each column represents a descriptive statistic.\n\n\nknitr::include_graphics(here::here(\"img\",\"Table1_1.png\"))\n\n\n\n\nSee - https://rpubs.com/emwozniak/195942\n5. Furniture (table1)\nProvides a simple summary table with means/counts and SDs/percentages.\nPros: - Uses a similar API to tidyverse groups and can be used in a pipe. - Provides bivariate test results for variable with grouping variable. - Flexible output: printed in console output, in latex (e.g., through kable), markdown and pandoc. - Can be exported to CSV.\nCons: - A little too simplistic; no clear row or column labels, no option for HTML format, limited ability to customise layout.\n\n\nknitr::include_graphics(here::here(\"img\",\"furniture.png\"))\n\n\n\n\nSee - https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/furniture/vignettes/Table1.html\n6. apaTables\nProduces tables that conform to APA style for several different types of analyses, e.g., correlation, ANOVA.\nPros: - Automates the process by which tables are created from analyses using R. - Ensures the tables are reproducible.\nCons: - Functions are restricted to specific analyses; limited ability to custome layout. - Package is for tables generated from analyses only; no specific table for descriptives, although correlation or one-way ANOVA table functions will produce a descriptives table (showing mean and SD only).\n\n\nknitr::include_graphics(here::here(\"img\",\"apatables.png\"))\n\n\n\n\nNote: the above table is taken from the CRAN vignette.\nSee - https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/apaTables/index.html\n7. arsenal\nComprises 6 functions designed to make statistical reporting easy. The relevant function for Table 1 is tableby(), which summarises a set of independent variables by one or more categorical variables.\nPros: - Lots of functionality: can customise most any aspect of the table. - Requires very little code, e.g., can create a table using only two lines of code. - Can stratify table by more than one grouping variable. - Can create a very simple table without any groupings.\nCons: - None that I am aware of at this stage!\n\n\nknitr::include_graphics(here::here(\"img\",\"arsenal.png\"))\n\n\n\n\nSee - https://github.com/mayoverse/arsenal\n8. qwraps2\nComprises numerous functions to summarise data and format results. These functions, or similar, can be found in other R packages.\nPros: - Extremely flexible; can customise every single line of a summary table. - Formatting tools, e.g., summary_table() for data summary tables in markdown; mean_sd, mean_ci for reporting formatted summary statistics. - Plotting tools, e.g., ggplot2_extract_legend() to extract the legend from a ggplot.\nCons: - Long lines of code.\n\n\nknitr::include_graphics(here::here(\"img\",\"qwraps.png\"))\n\n\n\n\nSee - https://github.com/dewittpe/qwraps2/\n9. amisc\nLittle information on this package as it is currently only available on GitHub.\nPros: - Produces a simple summary table showing key descriptives, e.g., mean, median, IQR, etc. - Uses pandoc.table() function to create a tidy, comprehensible table.\nCons: - Rather a basic package with little functionality.\nSee - https://github.com/ablejec/amisc\n\n\nknitr::include_graphics(here::here(\"img\",\"amisc.png\"))\n\n\n\n\nNote: above image is taken from https://thatdatatho.com/easily-create-descriptive-summary-statistic-tables-r-studio/\n10. tangram\n“A grammar of tables”; essentially a list of lists comprising cells that can be subclassed from almost anything.\nPros: - Nice aesthetics; short code. - High fuctionality. - Two types of style: one is internal to a cell and its formatting of text; the other is the overall styling of a table.\nCons: - Only knits to HTML. - Table does not show missing values by default.\nSee - https://github/spgarbet/tangram\n\n\nknitr::include_graphics(here::here(\"img\",\"tangram.png\"))\n\n\n\n\nNote: above image is taken from https://thatdatatho.com/easily-create-descriptive-summary-statistic-tables-r-studio/\n11. compareGroups\nPros: - Can create tables showing results of univariate analyses, stratified or not be categorical variable groupings. - Tables can be exported to csv, HTML, PDF, Word, xlsx, or inserted in R-markdown files. - Three main functions: 1) compareGroups creates an object that can be printed, summarised, plotted or updated 2) createTable creates an object that can be printed or summarised 3) export2csv, export2html, etc. will export results to csv, HTML, etc. - Quite simple to use. - Function descrTable builds descriptive statistics in a single step.\nCons: - Doesn’t display missing values by default.\n\n\nknitr::include_graphics(here::here(\"img\",\"compareGroups.png\"))\n\n\n\n\nSee - https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/compareGroups/vignettes/compareGroups_vignette.html\n12. gmisc\nA tool for producing “Table 1”, a transition plot displaying changes between categories, flow charts and a method for variable selection.\nPros: - getDescriptionStatsBy function returns everything you need to generate a descriptive table stratified by different variables. - mergeDesc function allows you to merge a set of outputs into a htmlTable. - Easy to re-label variables.\nCons: - Table can only be created in an HTML file. - Long lines of code.\nSee - https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Gmisc/index.html\n\n\nknitr::include_graphics(here::here(\"img\",\"gmisc.png\"))\n\n\n\n\nNote: above image is taken from https://thatdatatho.com/easily-create-descriptive-summary-statistic-tables-r-studio/\nDecision\nTO BE CONTINUED…\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nI have been tackling the Paper 1 dataset using the TableOne package. I hadn’t used TableOne before, so I first followed the instructions using the dataset from “Introduction to tableone” (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tableone/vignettes/introduction.html).\nI then applied the same instructions to the palmerpenguins dataset (https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/).\nWhen I felt comfortable using the package, I then turned to the dataset for Paper 1. I was able to easily replicate the mean and SD columns from Table 1, but there is no function in TableOne for range.\nI trawled the web searching for some kind of solution or work around. One PDF for the TableOne package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tableone/tableone.pdf) indicated that “The minMax argument toggles whether to show median [range]”. I had hoped this would give the minimum and maximum values for each, which may have been the best case scenario, but this was not the case.\nI finally stumbled upon the rndr (render) function that can be used for TableOne to display different statistics for different variables (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/table1/vignettes/table1-examples.html). It appears as though you can request that the minimum and maximum values are calculated for specific variables, although I can’t see an option to do this for all (and therefore not have to enter multiple lines of code requesting minimum and maximum values for each variable).\nMy first task for Week 4 will be to play around with the rndr function. Failing that, I will try to find a package that produces a similar table to TableOne, but includes mean, SD and range.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\na recap on the second week\nPlaying catch-up on my other courses had me neglecting this project for most of the week, so I’m glad I was able to spend Sunday reacquainting myself with R and running basic demographics for Paper 1 (2016).\nI started by converting the open data from each study into a .csv file, since some were .sav and others in various other formats. I then familiarised myself with each paper to ascertain which files were required for data replication. Some papers had multiple datasets with vague names, so this was a little tricky!\nJenny then put together a template for me to follow to perform the functions:\nread_csv(here) to read in data from Excel\nclean_names() to clean up the variable names and make them more decipherable\nglimpse() to obtain a summary of the dataset\ncount() to determine the number of participants\nsummarise() to obtain demographics, e.g., mean, SD\ntabyl() to count how many participants were assigned to each condition\nI had a basic understanding of R from the RYouWithMe online learning resources, but had not looked at these since mid-2020. So it was exciting to be presented with a new challenge and to encounter some unfamiliar functions (e.g., tabyl), and use various R blogs and databases to understand what each function performs and how to execute the command. It took some time trying to understand the aspects of the code (e.g., the piping function %>%), but I feel like I’ve learnt a lot today and already feel vastly more comfortable using R!\n\n\n\n",

The ozbabynames package contains data from birth records in Australia.\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ozbabynames)\n\n\n\nread the babynames data\n\n\nozbabynames <- ozbabynames\n\nglimpse(ozbabynames)\n\n\nRows: 252,358\nColumns: 5\n$ name  <chr> \"Charlotte\", \"Olivia\", \"Ava\", \"Amelia\", \"Mia\", \"Isla\"…\n$ sex   <chr> \"Female\", \"Female\", \"Female\", \"Female\", \"Female\", \"Fe…\n$ year  <int> 2017, 2017, 2017, 2017, 2017, 2017, 2017, 2017, 2017,…\n$ count <int> 577, 550, 464, 442, 418, 392, 378, 353, 351, 339, 334…\n$ state <chr> \"New South Wales\", \"New South Wales\", \"New South Wale…\n\ndefine the names you want to compare\nbtw Lady Gaga’s real name is Stefani\n\n\nartist_names <- c(\"Billie\", \"Taylor\", \"Stefani\")\n\n\n\nwhose name is most popular??\n\n\nozbabynames %>%\n  filter(name %in% artist_names) %>%\n  group_by(name, year) %>% \n  summarise(count = sum(count)) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = year, \n             y = count,\n             colour = name)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  theme_bw() +\n facet_wrap(~name,\n            scales = \"free_y\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\nWhat does the scales = \"free y\" do? What happens if you delete it? Is the plot more meaningful with “free y” or without it?\nChanges the scale on the Y axis so that it varies for each plot depending on the frequency for each, e.g., for Stefani, the plot appears as almost a straight line when ‘free y’ is removed, but more clearly shows a peak around 1998 when ‘free y’ is added.\nRecreate the plot above with your names\n\n\nyour_names <- c(\"Bonnie\", \"Siobhan\")\n\n\n\nWhat do you need to change about the code below to make it plot your names?\n\n\nozbabynames %>%\n  filter(name %in% your_names) %>%\n  group_by(name, year) %>% \n  summarise(count = sum(count)) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = year, \n             y = count,\n             colour = name)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  theme_bw() +\n facet_wrap(~name,\n            scales = \"free_y\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\nDo you need scales = \"free_y\"?\nMaybe. Without it, the data for the name “Siobhan” appears as a somewhat flat, squiggly line, but it is easy to compare it to the name Bonnie when they are placed side by side.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\na recap on the first week\nWe decided that my internship project would involve selecting several open data research papers from the Psychological Science journal and trying to replicate the data using R.\nIn doing so, I hope to learn exactly how straightforward it is to replicate the data from these open science papers, and to become more comfortable using R, as I really think it’s a fantastic statistical program.\nIn Week 1, I set out to customise my blog site, select some open data science papers I found interesting, and plan what I hope to achieve each week as part of this internship.\nTasks that I completed this week include:\nCustomising my blog site, e.g., changing the theme, updating details on the home page, publishing a test blog post\nFinding & saving the data from 5 research papers with open data - I’ve chosen one for each year from 2016-2020\nSaving links to the research papers & open data on a page linked to my blog site*\n*One of my tasks this week is to actually link said page to my blog. I can pull up the page by searching for it in the search bar on my blog, but there is no direct link from my site at the moment.\nI did not put together a plan for each week, so that will be a task for this week! As well as starting to look at the 2016 paper and determining the steps required to replicate the data on R.\n\n\n\n",
