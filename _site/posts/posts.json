    "contents": "\ndata viz with ggplot\nload packages\nWe can use the library() function to load the packages we need. The tidyverse package contains tons of useful functions for data wrangling and visualisation (including ggplot). The ozbabynames package contains data from birth records in Australia.\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ozbabynames)\n\n\n\nread the babynames data\n\n\nozbabynames <- ozbabynames\n\nglimpse(ozbabynames)\n\n\nRows: 252,358\nColumns: 5\n$ name  <chr> \"Charlotte\", \"Olivia\", \"Ava\", \"Amelia\", \"Mia\", \"Isla\"…\n$ sex   <chr> \"Female\", \"Female\", \"Female\", \"Female\", \"Female\", \"Fe…\n$ year  <int> 2017, 2017, 2017, 2017, 2017, 2017, 2017, 2017, 2017,…\n$ count <int> 577, 550, 464, 442, 418, 392, 378, 353, 351, 339, 334…\n$ state <chr> \"New South Wales\", \"New South Wales\", \"New South Wale…\n\ndefine the names you want to compare\nbtw Lady Gaga’s real name is Stefani\n\n\nartist_names <- c(\"Billie\", \"Taylor\", \"Stefani\")\n\n\n\nwhose name is most popular??\n\n\nozbabynames %>%\n  filter(name %in% artist_names) %>%\n  group_by(name, year) %>% \n  summarise(count = sum(count)) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = year, \n             y = count,\n             colour = name)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  theme_bw() +\n facet_wrap(~name,\n            scales = \"free_y\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\nWhat does the scales = \"free y\" do? What happens if you delete it? Is the plot more meaningful with “free y” or without it?\nChanges the scale on the Y axis so that it varies for each plot depending on the frequency for each, e.g., for Stefani, the plot appears as almost a straight line when ‘free y’ is removed, but more clearly shows a peak around 1998 when ‘free y’ is added.\nRecreate the plot above with your names\n\n\nyour_names <- c(\"Bonnie\", \"Siobhan\")\n\n\n\nWhat do you need to change about the code below to make it plot your names?\n\n\nozbabynames %>%\n  filter(name %in% your_names) %>%\n  group_by(name, year) %>% \n  summarise(count = sum(count)) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = year, \n             y = count,\n             colour = name)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  theme_bw() +\n facet_wrap(~name,\n            scales = \"free_y\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\nDo you need scales = \"free_y\"?\nMaybe. Without it, the data for the name “Siobhan” appears as a somewhat flat, squiggly line, but it is easy to compare it to the name Bonnie when they are placed side by side.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\na recap on the first week\nWe decided that my internship project would involve selecting several open data research papers from the Psychological Science journal and trying to replicate the data using R.\nIn doing so, I hope to learn exactly how straightforward it is to replicate the data from these open science papers, and to become more comfortable using R, as I really think it’s a fantastic statistical program.\nIn Week 1, I set out to customise my blog site, select some open data science papers I found interesting, and plan what I hope to achieve each week as part of this internship.\nTasks that I completed this week include:\nCustomising my blog site, e.g., changing the theme, updating details on the home page, publishing a test blog post\nFinding & saving the data from 5 research papers with open data - I’ve chosen one for each year from 2016-2020\nSaving links to the research papers & open data on a page linked to my blog site*\n*One of my tasks this week is to actually link said page to my blog. I can pull up the page by searching for it in the search bar on my blog, but there is no direct link from my site at the moment.\nI did not put together a plan for each week, so that will be a task for this week! As well as starting to look at the 2016 paper and determining the steps required to replicate the data on R.\n\n\n\n",
