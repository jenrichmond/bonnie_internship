In the console, type…\n\ncreate_post(\"whatever you want the title to be\")\n\nThis function will open a new folder within the _posts folder and a new .Rmd template for you to write in. You should edit the authors (it will default to those used last), write a description for your post, and add your text. To add a picture, save it into the img folder and insert a chunk with the following code inside.\n\nknitr::include_graphics(here::here(\"img\", \"whatever.png\"))\n\n\n\n\nWriting in RMarkdown is different to writing in Word.\nThe RMarkdown reference guide is helpful in learning how to create formatted text in R-Markdown. To preview what your formatted text will look like, use the “Knit” button on the top bar, or the keyboard shortcut Shift-Command-K.\n\n\n\n",
