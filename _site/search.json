It is set up to plot the popularity of some famous musicians names, but you can customise the code to make it plot your names. Don’t forget to update the author details in the top “yaml” section of the post too.\nwhatever.Rmd\nthis is a placeholder for your first real post. You can use it, or follow the instructions below to create a post from scratch.\nTo create a new post, use the create_post() function. In the console, type…\n\ncreate_post(\"whatever you want the title to be\")\n\nThis function will open a new folder within the _posts folder and a new .Rmd template for you to write in. You should edit the authors (it will default to those used last), write a description for your post, and add your text. To add a picture, save it into the img folder and insert a chunk with the following code inside.\n\nknitr::include_graphics(here::here(\"img\", \"nameofyourimage.png\"))\n\n\n\n\nArticles\nYou can make other pages/articles appear in your site too. The template includes the following “articles”, which are all editable by you.\ncoding.Rmd This would be a good file to edit to keep notes on what you are learning in coding sessions.\nproject.Rmd\nThis would be a good file to edit as you make progress on your group project.\n\n\n\n",
