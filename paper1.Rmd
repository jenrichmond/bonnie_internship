# Summary


Obesity is a growing health and financial burden across the world, and as such, it is becoming increasingly important to identify, and reduce or eliminate, risk factors for obesity. Research from the early 2000s suggests that low SES in childhood is a major predictor of obesity and insulin resistance in adulthood. This finding is consistent with life-history theory, which predicts that experience of conditions typical of low SES-environments in childhood will shape development such that the child learns how best to survive in harsh and unpredictable environments. That is, an individual may learn to eat as much as they can and whenever they can, if they grew up in a low SES-environment where food was unreliable or frequently unavailable.

In line with these early findings and life-history theory, Hill and colleagues (2016) examined the relationship between childhood socioeconomic status (SES) and eating in the absence of energy need. In a series of studies, researchers measured or manipulated (by asking participants to fast for 5 hours) each participant's current energy need, quantified as length of time since last meal, current level of hunger and/or blood glucose levels. Researchers then provided participants with the opportunity to eat snack foods. Participants reported their childhood and current SES. 

Participants who grew up in high SES environments regulated their food intake according to their energy need. These participants ate more when their need was high than they did when their need was low. Conversely, participants who grew up in low SES consumed comparably large amounts of food when their energy need was both high and low. The researchers concluded that childhood SES may influence how an individual responds to internal, physiological cues in adulthood.

# Plan

There are 3 studies reported in this paper. For each study, the goal is to reproduce the ...

1. demographic descriptives (reported in Participants)
2. figures (column graphs reporting total calories as a function of SES and energy need/condition/glucose)
3. tables of descriptive statistics (M, SD, Range)

# demographics

For each study the authors report...

- how many students participated
- mean, SD, range age

They only included those with BMI < 30 and excluded those with food allergies or diabetes

## Study 1

### read in the data

 Use the here() function to tell R where to find your data. And use clean_names() from janitor to make the variable names easier to work with. 

```{r}
s1 <- read_csv(here("research_data", "eating_correlational.csv"))
  cleans1 <- clean_names(s1)
```

Use glimpse() to familiarise yourself with what is in the file and find the demographic variables. 

```{r}
glimpse(cleans1)
```


### count the participants

Use the count function to count how many participants there were. Are those that were excluded due to BMI or allergies/diabetes included in the dataset?? 


```{r}
count(cleans1, "p_id")

```

31 participants. Participants excluded due to BMI/allergies/diabetes not included in dataset.

### summarise age

Use the summarise function to get the mean, sd, min, and max age


```{r}
cleans1 %>%
  summarise(meanage = mean(age, na.rm = TRUE),
          sdage = sd(age, na.rm = TRUE),
          minage = min(age, na.rm = TRUE),
          maxage = max(age, na.rm = TRUE))

```


## Study 2

As for study 1, read in the data for Study 2, use count() to see how many participants there were, and summarise to get M, SD, min, and max age. 

```{r}
s2 <- read_csv(here("research_data", "eating_drink.csv"))
  cleans2 <- clean_names(s2)
```

### count the participants
```{r}
count(cleans2, "p_id")

```

### summarise age

```{r}
cleans2 %>%
  summarise(meanage = mean(age, na.rm = TRUE),
          sdage = sd(age, na.rm = TRUE),
          minage = min(age, na.rm = TRUE),
          maxage = max(age, na.rm = TRUE))
```


### count condition assignment

Which variable contains info about the condition participant were assigned to? Use tabyl to count how many were assigned to each condition. 

dummy1_water_sprite & dummy2_sprite_water

```{r}

cleans2 %>%
  tabyl(dummy1_water_sprite)
```


```{r}
cleans2 <- cleans2 %>%
  mutate(condition = case_when(dummy1_water_sprite == 1 ~ "water",
                               dummy1_water_sprite == 0 ~ "sprite")) %>%
  relocate(condition, .before = "gender")
 
names(cleans2)                             
```

Sprite = 31; Water = 29

## Study 3

Read the data and then use the count function to count how many participants there were in total and the tabyl function to count how many were men and women. Use summarise to get the mean, sd, min, and max age. 


```{r}
s3 <- read_csv(here("research_data", "eating_glucose.csv"))
  cleans3 <- clean_names(s3)
```

### count the participants
```{r}
count(cleans3, "p_id")

```

### summarise age

```{r}
cleans3 %>%
  summarise(meanage = mean(age, na.rm = TRUE),
          sdage = sd(age, na.rm = TRUE),
          minage = min(age, na.rm = TRUE),
          maxage = max(age, na.rm = TRUE))
```

### count male/female
```{r}
cleans3 %>%
  tabyl(gender)
```


# Tables

## Study 1

The goal is to reproduce the values and formatting of this table. 

```{r out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img","paper1_table1.png"))
```

### Using arsenal

```{r}
table_one <- tableby(~ age + weight_1 + childhood_ses_composite + lastate_1 + hungercurr + c_delicious + p_delicious + total_calories_eaten, 
                     data = cleans1)

my_labels <- list(
  age = "Age (years)",
  weight_1 = "Weight (pounds)",
  childhood_ses_composite = "Childhood socioeconomic status (1-7)",
  lastate_1 = "Hours since eating",
  hungercurr = "Hunger (1-7)",
  c_delicious = "Liking of the cookies (1-7)",
  p_delicious = "Liking of the pretzels (1-7)",
  total_calories_eaten = "Total calories consumed"
)
```


```{r, results= "asis"}

summary(table_one, labelTranslations = my_labels,
        title = "Table 1. Descriptive Statistics for Study 1")

```


- checking missing values

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/naniar/vignettes/getting-started-w-naniar.html

```{r}
library(naniar)

vis_miss(cleans1)
```
```{r}
cleans1 %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  vis_miss()

cleans1_nona <- cleans1 %>%
  na.omit()

cleans1_agena <- cleans1 %>%
  drop_na(age)
```


```{r}

table_two <- tableby (~ age + weight_1 + childhood_ses_composite + lastate_1 + hungercurr + c_delicious + p_delicious + total_calories_eaten, data = cleans1)

summary(table_two,
        labelTranslations = my_labels,
        title = "Table 1. Descriptive Statistics for Study 1")

```

### Summary

What did not replicate:

- The range for Weight (R gave 102-215, the paper gave 102-211).

- The mean for Hunger (R gave 3.774, the paper gave 4.23).

- The range for Liking of the pretzels (R gave 4-7, the paper gave 4-5).

What replicated: everything else

In the above cases, the values that did not replicate were only very slightly different, leading me to think that these could have been manual errors. 

## Study 2

The goal is to reproduce the values and formatting of this table.

```{r out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "paper1_table2.png"))
```

### Using arsenal

```{r}
cleans2 <- cleans2 %>%
  mutate(condition = case_when(dummy2_sprite_water == 1 ~ "Water condition",
                               dummy1_water_sprite == 1 ~ "Sprite condition"
                               ))
```

```{r}
table_two <- tableby(condition ~ weight_1 + child_ses + currnt_ses + hrs_no_eat_1 + hunglvl + delicious_taste + calories_eaten, data = cleans2)

my_labels <- list(
  weight_1 = "Weight (pounds)",
  child_ses = "Childhood socioeconomic status",
  currnt_ses = "Current socioeconomic status (single item; 1-7)",
  hrs_no_eat_1 = "Hours since eating",
  hunglvl = "Hunger (1-7)",
  delicious_taste = "Liking of the cookies (1-7)",
  calories_eaten = "Total calories consumed"
)
```


```{r, results= "asis"}

summary(table_two, labelTranslations = my_labels,
        title = "Table 2. Descriptive Statistics for Study 2")
```

### Summary

The difficulties I encountered in reproducing this table were primarily due to the labelling of the two conditions. I thought Dummy1_Water_Sprite represented the Water condition, and Dummy2_Sprite_Water the Sprite condition, as per the first drink listed in each label. However, upon checking the codebook as part of the researchers' data, the opposite was true. That is, when Dummy1_Water_Sprite = 0, then the participant is in the Water condition, and when Dummy1_Water_Sprite = 1, the participant is in the Sprite condition. It is therefore also the case that when Dummy2_Sprite_Water = 0, the participant is in the Sprite condition, and when Dummy2_Sprite_Water = 1, the participant is in the Water condition.

What replicated:

- Sprite condition: The mean for Hours since eating.

- Water condition: THe mean for Liking of the cookies.

What did not replicate: everything else*

*All descriptives that did not replicate were within 0.9 mean units and SD units, excluding Weight, which was within 2 mean units and 1 SD unit). This leads me to believe that the discrepancy in descriptives between Table 2 in the paper and as reproduced by R is likely due to manual error by the researchers.

## Study 3

The goal is to reproduce the values and formatting of this table.

```{r out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "paper1_table3.png"))
```
### Using arsenal

```{r}
cleans3 <- cleans3 %>%
  mutate(condition = case_when(sprite_water_dummy2 == 1 ~ "Water condition",
                               water_sprite_dummy == 1 ~ "Sprite condition"
                               ))
```

```{r}
table_three <- tableby(condition ~ weight + child_ses + adult_ses + blood_draw_2_post_maip + delicious_taste + calories_eaten, data = cleans3)

my_labels <- list(
  weight = "Weight (pounds)",
  child_ses = "Childhood socioeconomic status (1-7)",
  adult_ses = "Current socioeconomic status (1-7)",
  blood_draw_2_post_maip = "Blood glucose level (mg/dl)",
  delicious_taste = "Liking of the cookies (1-7)",
  calories_eaten = "Total calories consumed"
)
```


```{r, results= "asis"}

summary(table_three, labelTranslations = my_labels,
        title = "Table 3. Descriptive Statistics for Study 3")
```

### Summary

Like Table 2, the difficulties I encountered in reproducing this table were primarily due to the labelling of the two conditions. I thought sprite_water_dummy2 represented the Sprite condition, and water_sprite_dummy the Water condition, as per the first drink listed in each label. However, upon checking the codebook, the opposite was again true. That is, when sprite_water_dummy2 = 0, the participant is in the Sprite condition, and when sprite_water_dummy2 = 1, the participant is in the Water condition. It is therefore also the case that when water_sprite_dummy = 0, the participant is in the Water condition, and when water_sprite_dummy = 1, the participant is in the Sprite condition. 

What replicated: all descriptives for the Water condition.

What did not replicate: all descriptives for the Sprite condition.*

*All descriptives that did not replicate were within 1 mean unit and SD unit, excluding Weight, which was within 4 mean units and 1 SD unit). Like Table 2, this leads me to believe that the discrepancy in descriptives between Table 3 in the paper and as reproduced by R is likely due to manual error by the researchers.
