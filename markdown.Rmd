Writing in RMarkdown is different to writing in Word. What you see is not quite what you get. To preview what your formatted text will look like, use the "Knit" button on the top bar, or the keyboard shortcut *Shift-Command-K*. 


# 1. Italics and Bold 

If you want italics or bold use asterisks. 

### Raw Rmd 

```
*one asterisk* 

**two asterisks**

```

### Knitted Rmd 

*one asterisk* 

**two asterisks**


## 2. Levels of heading

You can get levels of heading with hash. 

### Raw Rmd 

```
# BIG HEADING
## Smaller Heading
### even smaller heading

```
### Knitted Rmd

# BIG HEADING
## SMALLER HEADING
### EVEN SMALLER HEADING


# 3. Bullets

You can get bullet points using dash...

### Raw Rmd

```
- first important point
- second point
- and third... 

```

### Knitted Rmd
- first important point
- second point
- and third... 


# 4. Code Chunks

You can insert code "chunks" by using the shortcut, *Option-Command-I* or choosing Insert R from the top menu bar. 

The power of RMarkdown comes from being able to intersperse code chunks, output, and explanation in the same document. 

### this is a code chunk
```{r echo=TRUE}

print("hello world")
```


# 5. Images

Save your image file in the `img` folder and tell R where to find it using the `include_graphics()` and `here::here()` functions

```{r echo=TRUE}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "band.jpg"))

```
