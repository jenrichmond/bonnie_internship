knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

Writing in RMarkdown is different to writing in Word. What you see is not quite what you get. 

If you want italics use *one asterisk*. For bold, use **two asterisks**. You can get levels of heading with hash. 

# BIG HEADING
## SMALLER HEADING
### EVEN SMALLER HEADING

You can get bullet points using dash...

- first important point
- second point
- and third... 


You can include code "chunks" by using the shortcut, option-command I or choosing Insert R from the top menu bar. 

Code chunks are useful for including code for plots with your text and also useful for inserting pictures

Save your image file in the `img` folder and tell R where to find it using the include_graphics() function

```{r echo=TRUE}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "band.jpg"))

```
```




The [RMarkdown reference guide](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf?_ga=2.15167350.1148129883.1606704012-1288179797.1570929100) is helpful in learning how to create formatted text in R-Markdown. To preview what your formatted text will look like, use the "Knit" button on the top bar, or the keyboard shortcut *Shift-Command-K*.
