```

You can customise the look and feel of your distill site pretty easily. See some examples of other sites made with distill [here](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/distill/articles/examples.html). 

# 1. Change the name of your site

In the top left corner, your site is currently called "internship blog". You might want to change that to the name of your group. Open the _site.yml file and update the title. 

You can also change the welcome message. Open the index.Rmd file and change the title. 

# 2. Change the colour scheme
