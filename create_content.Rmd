```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

To create a new post, use the `create_post()` function. In the console, type...

```

create_post("whatever you want the title to be")

```

This function will open a new folder within the `_posts` folder and a new .Rmd template for you to write in. You should edit the authors (it will default to those used last), write a description for your post, and add your text. To add a picture, save it into the `img` folder and insert a chunk with the following code inside. 

```

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "whatever.png"))

```

```{r}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "whatever.png"))

```



Writing in RMarkdown is different to writing in Word. 

The [RMarkdown reference guide](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf?_ga=2.15167350.1148129883.1606704012-1288179797.1570929100) is helpful in learning how to create formatted text in R-Markdown. To preview what your formatted text will look like, use the "Knit" button on the top bar, or the keyboard shortcut *Shift-Command-K*.
