# About me

Hi! I'm Bonnie, a third year Bachelor of Psychology student. This is my internship blog where I will be posting about my journey learning R and my progress in reproducing the data from various research papers. 

I love exploring the Blue Mountains and am a serious Swiftie (Taylor's Version).
